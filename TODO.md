# Todo List

## Source Code

- Cleanup object property merging for the options arguments. There is a lot of object de-structuring that can probably be cleanly refactored.
- Create high-level APIs for Diablo III, Starcraft II, and Hearthstone.
- Check for and handle bad or unexpected inputs based on valid inputs defined in the data files.

## Test Coverage

- Create low-level API tests.
- Ensure API throttling is working properly when bombarding requests.
